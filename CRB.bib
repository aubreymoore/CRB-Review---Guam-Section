	abstract = {Coconut, oil, and date palms are important crops in the tropics and are attacked by dynastids that cause loss of production or death of hosts. Knowledge of their breeding sites has been extended since a previous review in 1980. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae has potential as a biopesticide against immature stages in friable breeding sites. The molecular biology and ultrastructure of Oryctes rhinoceros Nudivirus (OrNV), disseminated by adults, have been studied, and this pathogen can reduce O. rhinoceros populations and damage when introduced into new locations, especially where damage had been high. New PCR techniques may enable reliable quantification of dosages ingested and hence virulence of different isolates. Male-produced aggregation pheromones have been identified in several species, for which they may have management potential, having been used commercially for trapping O. rhinoceros in oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia, and tested against O. monoceros in Africa.},

The abundance of beetles is surprising given that the Malay peninsula was the site of first discovery of the Oryctes virus, which has been used to effect good as a biological control agent in other regions. A survey of adult beetles was carried out throughout Malaysia using pheromone traps. Captured beetles were examined for presence of virus using both visual/microscopic examination and PCR detection methods. The survey indicated that Oryctes virus was common in Malaysia among the adult beetles. Viral DNA analysis was carried out after restriction with HindIII enzyme and indicated at least three distinct viral genotypes. Bioassays were used to compare the viral strains and demonstrate that one strain (type B) is the most virulent against both larvae and adults of the beetle. Virus type B has been cultured and released into healthy populations where another strain (type A) forms the natural background. Capture and examination of beetles from the release site and surrounding area has shown that the spread and persistence of the applied virus strain is accompanied by a reduction in palm frond damage.},

	abstract = {Although the use of aggregation pheromones has been reported for hundreds of nonsocial arthropod species, the evolutionary ecological aspects of this behavior have received little attention. Despite the elaborate literature on mechanisms, robust data on costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones are scant. Existing literature indicates that, in contrast to the diversity of mechanisms, the ecological conditions in which aggregation pheromones are used are more alike. This points to a few general categories for costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones, and these are discussed. We subsequently review interspecific interactions that may be affected by the use of aggregation pheromones. We encounter a strikingly frequent association of aggregation pheromones with fungi and microorganisms and address cross-attraction by competitor species and exploitation by natural enemies. We show that aggregative behavior by individuals through the use of pheromones can profoundly affect ecological interactions and advocate further evolutionary and ecological investigations of pheromone-mediated aggregation.},

	abstract = {In view of the increasing and devastating damage by rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) to coconut palms in the middle of last century, many efforts were made to find an efficient natural control factor against this pest, which could not be controlled by pesticides. The basic procedures of these monitoring programmes are outlined together with the final detection of a virus disease in oil palm estates in Malaysia in 1963. In extensive laboratory studies, the virus was isolated and identified as the first non-occluded, rod-shaped insect virus, morphologically resembling the baculoviruses. Infection experiments clarified the pathology, histopathology, and virulence of the virus and demonstrated that the virus was extremely virulent to larvae after peroral application. These findings encouraged the first pilot release of virus in 1967 in coconut plantations of Western Samoa where breeding sites were contaminated with virus. Surprisingly, the virus became established in the Samoan rhinoceros beetle populations and spread autonomously throughout the Western Samoan islands. As a consequence, there was a drastic decline of the beetle populations followed by a conspicuous recovery of the badly damaged coconut stands. This unexpected phenomenon could only be explained after it was shown that the adult beetle itself is a very active virus vector and thus was responsible for the efficient autodissemination of the virus. The functioning of the beetle as a 'flying virus factory' is due to the unique cytopathic process developing in the midgut after peroral virus infection. Pathological details of this process are presented. Because of the long-term persistence of the virus in the populations, rhinoceros beetle control is maintained. Incorporation of virus into integrated control measures and successful virus releases in many other countries are recorded. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The DSIR-HA-1179 coleopteran cell line is a susceptible and permissive host to the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV), which has been used as a biocontrol agent against the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros); a pest of palms in the Asia-Pacific region. However, little is known about growth and metabolism of this cell line, knowledge of which is necessary to develop an in vitro large-scale OrNV production process. The strong anchorage-dependent characteristics of the cell line, its particular fragility and its tendency to form dense clumps when manipulated, are the most likely reasons that have precluded further development of the cell line. In order to characterize DSIR-HA-1179 cells, there was first a need for a reliable technique to count the cells. A homogenous cell suspension suitable for enumeration could be produced by treatment with TrypLE Express™ with optimum mean time for cell release calculated as 30 min. The cell line was adapted to grow in four serum-supplemented culture media namely TC-100, IPL-41, Sf-900 II and Sf-900 III and cell growth, glucose consumption, lactate and ammonia production were assessed from static-batch cultures. The maximum viable cell density was reached in Sf-900 II (17.9 × 10(5) cells/ml), with the maximum specific growth rate observed in this culture medium as well (0.0074 h(-1)). Higher production of OrNV was observed in IPL-41 and TC-100 (4.1 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) than in cultures infected in Sf-900 III (2.0 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) and Sf-900 II (1.4 × 10(7) TCID50/ml). At the end of the growth period, glucose was completely consumed in cultures grown in TC-100, while remained in excess in the other three culture media. The cell line produced lactate and ammonia to very low levels in the TC-100 culture medium which is a promising aspect for its cultivation at large-scale.},

	abstract = {Dynastinae beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are important due to their role in recycling plant material and promoting nutrient turnover. However, some species are phytophagous and can attack crop plants, thus becoming pests. Here, we provide information on the biology and behavior of the rhinoceros beetle Enema pan (F.) (Oryctini), an abundant species in the area of Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone, Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Adults were collected with a light trap deployed daily from January 2006 to December 2007 in the experimental farm of the Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (Aquidauana campus). Adults were maintained in plastic containers and observations were made daily. Temporal distribution of adults of E. pan occurred in September and October (2006) and from October to December (2007). Flight started at 1930 hours and ended at 2330 hours. Twenty-four eggs (3.28 mm in length by 2.32 mm in width) with a whitish color were ovipositioned directly in to the soil. Adult longevity averaged 22.0 d in the laboratory conditions. Cephalic horn length, body length, and width of E. pan males are greater than those of females. The weight of adults of both sexes was similar. Cephalic horn length of the males of E. pan was positively correlated with his body size. Mating occurred between 0800 and 1030 hours and lasted on average 18.1 min in the laboratory. Several fights among males and other behaviors involving males and females were observed and are reported. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

	url = {http://www.sipweb.org/docs/Program%20and%20Abstracts%202014.pdf},
	abstract = {The discovery of Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s by Dr
Alois Huger enabled the successful management of coconut
rhinoceros beetle (Orytes rhinoceros) populations through
classical biocontrol release in the Pacific, SE Asian, and Indian
Ocean regions. OrNV continues to be an important biocontrol
agent for the control of Oryctes rhinoceros in both coconut and
oil palm growing regions. Augmentative release of OrNV is
commonly used to enhance the natural spread and ensure its
continued presence within palm growing regions and
surrounding areas. For over four decades after the distribution
of the virus, O. rhinoceros was not reported to have
established in any new regions. However, in 2007 the beetle
was discovered in Guam and the population has now
established with a highly damaging outbreak such as those not
seen for 40+ years. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the
Guam population were unexpectedly unsuccessful. This has
raised the possibility the O. rhinoceros population that invaded
Guam is less susceptible to OrNV, or potentially resistant.
Furthermore, near the end of 2013, a population of O.
rhinoceros was detected in Hawaii, although it is not believed
to have established yet. The discovery of new O. rhinoceros
invasions within the Pacific region linked with the possibility of
a virus tolerant population suggests the beetle may again be
on the move. To assist efforts in identifying the source
populations for the Guam outbreak, a simple PCR-RFLP
method has been developed to distinguish Guam O.
rhinoceros from other populations. Analysis of several O.
rhinoceros populations has demonstrated that the Hawaiian
beetles are of the same haplotype as those found in Guam.
We will discuss current results in relation to what is known
about these new invasions and potential implications for the
future.},

Compared with stumps and coconut trunks on the ground, dead standing palms were preferred for breeding and contained baculovirus-infected larvae 5- to 15-fold more frequently. The percentage of baculovirus-infected breeding sites increased with density of dead standing palms up to about five dead palms per hectare, but then decreased again. Larva mortality was higher in dead standing palms and stumps than in trunks on the ground. Rainfall was also a significant mortality factor. Palm damage due to O. rhinoceros increased with density of stumps and trunks on the ground but not with density of dead standing palms. It is concluded that in the Philippines dead standing palms can play an important role in spread of baculovirus and regulation of O. rhinoceros populations.},

The transfer vector, a pUC8-based plasmid, contained the polyhedrin gene from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, flanked by Oryctes baculovirus DNA from the HindIII fragment N. Oryctes baculovirus does not form plaques with DSIR-HA-1179 cells. Therefore an endpoint dilution method was used to screen for, recover and purify recombinants. There was no phenotypic character that could be used for detecting recombinants, so a dot blot assay was used to screen infected cultures for the presence of recombinants. A recombinant generated by this method contained the entire polyhedrin gene inserted at 98.03 map units from the designated start of the Oryctes baculovirus physical map.

In Malaysia, in addition to well-known breeding sites it is able to multiply in shredded chipped old oil palm trunk material in replant areas, also in empty fruit bunches. The aggregation pheromone ethyl 4-methyloctanoate is produced by males of O. rhinoceros (also by the similar pest O. monoceros in Africa), and is used in traps as an important component of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and in ecological studies. In Malaysia, the incidence of endemic entomopathogens can be increased. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is available for use as a biopesticide against immature stages in breeding sites and may be distributed by adults. The molecular and ultrastructure of Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV) has been extensively studied. It kills larvae and is disseminated by adults. New PCR techniques may enable reliable estimates of the quantity of virions in experimental dosages ingested and hence of the virulence of different isolates. It is possible one isolate when released may out compete another.{\textbackslash}n},

The principle of this method is to estimate the epitopes not shared between the related viruses, after titration of the antibodies specific to the common epitopes as in a blocking ELISA. In practice, varying concentrations of purified virus are preincubated with a fixed dilution of heterologous or homologous antiserum and the unbound antibodies present in the mixture are back titrated with virus particles bound to microtitre plates. The antigenic relationship is described in terms of differentiation index (DI) and total antigenic reactivity (TAR).

	abstract = {Introduced mammals are major drivers of extinction. Feral goats (Capra hircus) are particularly devastating to island ecosystems, causing direct and indirect impacts through overgrazing, which often results in ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. Removing goat populations from islands is a powerful conservation tool to prevent extinctions and restore ecosystems. Goats have been eradicated successfully from 120 islands worldwide.With newly developed technology and techniques, island size is perhaps no longer a limiting factor in the successful removal of introduced goat populations. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems, geographic information systems, aerial hunting by helicopter, specialized hunting dogs, and Judas goats has dramatically increased efficiency and significantly reduced the duration of eradication campaigns. Intensive monitoring programs are also critical for successful eradications. Because of the presence of humans with domestic goat populations on large islands, future island conservation actions will require eradication programs that involve local island inhabitants in a collaborative approach with biologists, sociologists, and educators. Given the clear biodiversity benefits, introduced goat populations should be routinely removed from islands.},

	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros; CRB) is a major pest of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s has enabled the successful management of populations in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). Augmentative release of OrNV continues to be an important mechanism for CRB management in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. For {\textasciitilde}40 years after adoption of this biocontrol strategy, no new outbreaks of CRB were reported from uninfested palm growing countries and islands in the Pacific ensuring continuity of palm based village economies. However, the situation has recently changed. For first time in {\textasciitilde}40 years, CRB invasion into completely new areas has been reported in the Pacific, being detected first in Tumon Bay in Guam 2007, followed by Port Moresby in PNG 2010, Honolulu in Hawaii 2013, and Honiara in Solomon Islands 2015. Additionally, Pacific areas with established CRB populations (e.g. Palau) have reported increased severity and frequency of CRB damage. Common to all these areas is the high incidence of severe palm damage, not seen since the introduction of OrNV. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam CRB population were unexpectedly unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the CRB-G population that invaded Guam could be tolerant or resistant to the commonly applied OrNV isolates. Analysis of several CRB populations has demonstrated that the CRB-G biotype is also found in Hawaii, Palau, and recently (February 2015) in Port Moresby (PNG), with Honiara (Solomon Islands) still to be confirmed. We will discuss current results in relation to what is known about these new invasions and potential implications for the future.},

	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) is a severe pest of coconut and other palms that has invaded the South Pacific in the last decade. The beetle can cause great economic losses, not only to agriculture but also due to indirect impacts on tropical aesthetics and tourism. In the last decade, new invasive populations of the beetle have been detected on Guam and Oahu, Hawaii. Despite the beetle’s extensive invasion history and economic impacts, little is known about its invasion dynamics. We used 1,480 base pairs of cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitochondrial and 814 base pairs of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase nuclear DNA to conduct a population genetics analysis on eight beetle populations from Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China in the beetle’s native range and Palau, American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii in the beetle’s invasive range, in an attempt to resolve invasion pathways. Genetic diversity was insufficient to generate strong evidence for O. rhinoceros movement patterns. Mitochondrial DNA provided a clear but poorly supported population structure. Although nuclear DNA proved to be more diverse, population structure lacked clear signal. This lack of diversity is congruent with a rapid, recent invasion. There appears to be no genetic exchange between populations once they establish, implying that they are rare, human-mediated dispersal events.},

	abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros, commonly known as the coconut rhinoceros beetle  (CRB)  (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), is large invasive scarab beetle native to
Southeast Asia. CRB is a major pest of coconut palm trees (Cocos nucifera) in its expanded range which includes tropical islands in the Pacific, and 
most recently the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian archipelago. For decades a double-stranded DNA virus, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV; family 
Nudiviridae, genus Alphanudivirus), has been an effective biological control agent reducing the impact of CRB in its native and expanded range. CRB 
arrived  in  Oahu  in  2013  and  an  intensive  eradication  effort  is  currently  underway.  The  purpose  of  this  study  is to  determine  whether  OrNV  is 
present in Oahu’s incipient CRB population, as its presence may positively impact eradication efforts. To date, 21 field-caught CRB specimens have 
been assayed for OrNV using a PCR-based assay, all of which have been determined to be negative for the virus. This suggests that OrNV did not 
accompany CRB during its invasion of Oahu, and/or CRB on Oahu are resistant to the virus. We also assayed CRB specimens from several locations 
in Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands for the presence of OrNV and examined the genetic diversity of the virus within a 945 bp region of the gene 
coding  for  the  gp83-like  protein. OrNV  could  be  found  in  all  locations  from  which  specimens  were  collected,  with  the  island  of Guam  being  an 
exception. Sequence analyses of OrNV isolates indicate low genetic diversity, which may limit the genotypes of CRB this virus may be able to infect.},

	abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was first detected
on Guam during 2007. Following a failed eradication
program, we attempted to establish effective
microbial control using Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus
(OrNV) imported from AgResearch New Zealand
and green muscardine fungus (GMF), Metarhizium
majus, imported from the Philippine Coconut
Authority. OrNV was initially released by
autodissemination but did not result in population
suppression. Molecular analyses indicated that the
Guam population is genetically distinct from other
populations which had invaded Pacific Islands and
laboratory bioassays indicated that this genotype is
resistant to infection by OrNV isolates commonly
used and released in the Pacific region. This novel
biotype has been named CRB Biotype G (CRB-G) and
it is spreading throughout the Pacific. GMF was
released by autodissemination and incorporation of
spores into CRB breeding sites. An extensive post-
release survey indicated that field mortality from
GMF was between 10\% and 38\%. Population
suppression by GMF coupled with breeding site
sanitation and other integrated pest management
tactics did not prevent an uncontrolled island-wide
CRB outbreak triggered by Typhoon Dolphin which
passed over Guam in May 2015. Adults emerging
from abundant CRB breeding sites generated by this
typhoon were numerous enough to kill large
numbers of mature coconuts, initiating a positive
feedback cycle whereby adults emerging from dead
palms kill even more palms. History indicates that
the most feasible way to stop the current outbreak
on Guam is to find and release an OrNV isolate
which is pathogenic for CRB-G. We are currently
locating populations of CRB-G biotype within its
native range and looking for OrNV isolates from
these populations which can be used for effective
microbial control.},
